## Machine Learning  + MRI = Saving Lives

Magnetic Resonance Imaging is one of the most popular medical technologies for prostate cancer diagnosis. Typically, doctors look at individual images to assess the classify the cancerous and non-cancerous areas of the prostate...**but what if there was a smarter - and faster - way to diagnose**? In our project, we will use machine learning to identify the cancerous areas of a prostate.
