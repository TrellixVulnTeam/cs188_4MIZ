## A data-driven, machine learning based exploration into medical image diagnostics. 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging is among the most important ways to diagnose prostate cancer. Typically, doctors look at individual images to assess the severity of prostate cancer tumors... but what if ther was a smarter way to diagnose? In our project, we will use machine learning to classify prostate tumors according to their severity.
