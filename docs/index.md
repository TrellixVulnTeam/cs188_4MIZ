## Machine Learning  + MRI = Saving Lives

Magnetic Resonance Imaging is one of the most popular medical technologies for prostate cancer diagnosis. Typically, doctors look at individual images to assess the severity of prostate cancer tumors...**but what if there was a smarter - and faster - way to diagnose**? In our project, we will use machine learning to classify prostate tumors according to their severity.

Stay tuned for more details!
