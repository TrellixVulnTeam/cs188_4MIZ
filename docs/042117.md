## 04/21/17: Meeting Dr. Fabien Scalzo

Today we met with Dr. Fabien Scalzo, the insructor for the course and an expert on the application of machine learning to biomedical imaging. Dr. Scalzo focuses on the computer science aspects of the prostate project. Specifically, he researches the best ways to use the imaging data for machine learning as well as the best methods to use for acheiving highly accurate diagnoses.


### Defining the project's goals

Dr. Scalzo recommended that we first conduct a survey of different machine learning methods on the dataset for tumor identification only. Later on, if there is time we will focus on producing accurate Gleason ratings. Therefore we will first focus on producing accurate binary classification of the tumors (*e.g.*, whether cancer is present or not) before moving onto prediction of the Gleason rating, which is fundamentally a regression problem.

In essence, we will be reproducing Fabien's work on "heatmapping" images of prostates with different machine learning methods. The "hot" areas of the prostate are more likely to have cancer, while the "cold" areas are less likely.

### Data analysis

In the upcoming days Fabien will provide us with a series of ~30 patient's sets of images as `.mat` and Excel files. The T2 MRI, DWI, and ADC images are represented as large spatial arrays with each pixel asssigned to an intensity. In addition, binary overlays from pathologist data (or Nelly's work) will outline exactly which pixels are considered cancerous and which are considered benign. The pathologist-reviewed Gleason scores will also be included with the images.

We will work to transform the data from the given array form into forms that are more conducive to machine learning methods such as SVM or Logistic regression. Also, we have decided the use the [SciKit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library (`sklearn`) in `python` for our data analysis.

Stay tuned for more updates as we get a first look at the dataset, identify the specific set of machine learning methods we will test, and decide on the best ways to represent our data!
