# Normalizing the Images

## Motivation 

From some our tests, we noticed that pixel intensity values of the t2 images ranged from 0 to 400+. We were unsure if the scale varied among the t2 images, so we made an attempt to normalize all of our t2 images. 

## The Code

* TO DO: LINK TO PRIOR BLOG POST ABOUT CROSSVALIDATE *

Our `crossvalidate` function discussed [before]() now takes in an additional keyword argument known as `normalized`. `normalized` can be set to either True or False. We created a `normalize_t2` to perform the following: 

```python
def normalize_t2(data):
    flat_data = []

    for i, patient in enumerate(data):
        if i in good_patients:
            t2 = patient[1]
            flat_data.append(t2.flatten())

    normalized_flat_data = normalize(flat_data)
    normalized_data = [np.reshape(datum, (256, 256)) for datum in normalized_flat_data]
    return normalized_data
```

`normalize_t2` is called by `runmodel` if `normalized=True`. In order to normalize all the t2 images against each other, we first flattened the t2 data into a single array. After normalization, the array is reshaped into the original 256 x 256 image. 

## The Results 

In our `ensemble.py` script, our main function ran the following: 

```python
crossvalidate(model2, filter_on=False, adc_on=False, normalized=True)
```

The following options were passed to `ensemble.py`: 

```
$ ensemble.py 3 y
```

This ran our script with `n = 3` with additional pruning. 

| GBC without Normalization                                  | GBC with Normalization        |
|:----------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
| 0.6670                                                     | 0.6543                        |


Based on our results, we found that normalization did not improve our overall cross validated score. Instead, it slightly decreased. We were curious on how the normalized images actually looked like and found the following: 

![Patient 0 Original vs Normalized][patient0_normalized]

The image on the top is the original t2 image of [Patient 0](https://github.com/ardunn/cs188/tree/master/pyprostate/graphics/patient0). Below is the normalized version. From visual inspection, the images look more or less the same. Since normalization did not play a role in improving our image quality, we decided to move forward with filtering instead.
