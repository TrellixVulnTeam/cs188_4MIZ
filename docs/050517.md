# Receiving the Data 

Today we received the prostate MRI data from Professor Scalzo. Machine learning projects are nothing without data, so now we can begin working on our project. 

The data was given to us as a MATLAB file and contained MRI scans from 62 patients. Each struct contained the following information: 

* `slide_roi`: Mask of the the tumor, the prostate, and non-prostate region. The areas are marked as 2, 1, and 0 respectively.
* `t2`: t2 MRI Scan
* `adc`: Apparent Diffusion Coefficient image of MRI

The following images are various diffusion weigted images at different patterns. Professor Scalzo mentioned that he didn't use this for his initial research but said that there may be some value to them:
* `dwi0`
* `dwi100`
* `dwi400`
* `dwi800`
* `dwi2000`

`slide_roi` was obtained from a radiologists contour of the whole-mount histopathology. This image is not the same as the MRI scans included in our dataset. As such, Professor Scalzo advised for us to review each data and eliminate any data that had a big discrepancy between `slide_roi` and `t2`.  

With our dataset in had, we'll first begin with porting this data into Python using an existing python/MATLAB library. Stay tuned for more updates on our progess with code.
