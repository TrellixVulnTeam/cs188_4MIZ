## 04/14/17: Meeting Dr. Nelly Tan

Today we met with Dr, Nelly Tan, a Ronald Reagan Medical Center clinician working alongside Dr. Fabien Scalzo for training machine learning models to assess the severity of prostate cancer. Dr. Tan focuses on acquiring and manually verifying image data to pass onto Dr. Scalzo, who handles the machine learning aspect of the project. During our meeting, Dr. Tan briefed us on the clinical background of our project. 

### Finding Tumors

To find tumors, medical professionals image the prostate using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Tumor cells have different physical characteristics from healthy prostate tissue, so MRI imaging resolves tumors as having different intensities in digital images. Clinicians also observe the water restriction of the prostate to obtain more information, since tumors do not uptake water as well as healthy tissue. Additionally, the amount of water restriction aids clinicians in diagnosing the severity of the cancer, as more agressive tumors uptake less water than less agressive cancers.

In analyzing the prostate, clinicians use three sets of images. Sets of `.dcm` images (MRI standard file format) are prepared from pathologist-reviewed T2 MRI, ADC (apparent diffusion constant), and DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) sessions. Dr. Tan prepares annotated `.dcm` images by examining each one by hand, outlining areas of interest (tumors), and assigning a Gleason rating to the prostate. The Gleason scale is a widely-used metric for measuring the severity of prostate tumors. 

### The Gleason Scale

The Gleason scale ranges from 1-5 for an individual score; a higher score indicates more severe cancer, while a low score indicates no cancerous activity. Typically Gleason scores are assessed from two regions of the prostate, and the final Gleason score is the sum of the two individual scores. For example, an advanced cancer in prostate A may recieve a score of 4+5=9, while a low-risk cancer in prostate B may could get 1+2=3.

### Uses of the project

Dr. Tan also gave us some new insight into the usefulness of this project. While having an automatic system for analyzing prostate cancer risk is a long term goal of the project, medical professionals will likely be using the project more as a tool for increasing their efficiency of diagnosis. In other words, specialists like Dr. Tan still must review the images manually, but they will be able to pinpoint areas of interest more quickly. Furthermore, the project can be used as a tool to rapidly train novice clinicians in identifying prostate cancer. 

### What's next?
Now that we have a basic understanding of the medical background of the project, we will discuss the aspects of machine learning that will be used in this project with Dr. Scalzo in the upcoming week. Stay tuned for the next update!
